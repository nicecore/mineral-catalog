# Mineral Catalog

### A Treehouse Tech Degree Project in Python with Django

Note on loading minerals.json into the database:

1. The repo comes with the database all migrated and ready to go, but it's empty.

2. The function responsible for loading minerals into the database is in minerals/views and runs upon navigation to the homepage/mineral list.

3. Simply run the Django development server and navigate to the homepage to load the minerals.
